To automate blog generation on Vercel using the new API route, follow these steps:

Deploy your updated code to Vercel.
In your Vercel dashboard, go to your project settings â†’ "Cron Jobs".
Click "Add Cron Job".
Set the schedule you want (e.g., every day at 8am).
Set the URL to:
https://<your-vercel-domain>/api/scheduled-blog-generate
Choose the HTTP method: POST (recommended) or GET.
Optional:

For security, you can add a secret token check in the API route and pass it as a header or query param from the Cron Job.
Let me know if you want help adding authentication or have any issues with the setup!
